## The UX of ChatGPT in your React app 💬🚀

**assistant-ui** is an open source Typescript/React library for AI chat.

The library handles essential chat features such as auto-scrolling, accessibility, and real-time updates, while providing easy integration with LangGraph, AI SDK and custom backends.

The API of assistant-ui is inspired by libraries like shadcn/ui and cmdk. Instead of a single monolithic chat component, developers get primitive components that can be fully customized.

We have wide model provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Perplexity, AWS Bedrock, Azure, Google Gemini, Hugging Face, Fireworks, Cohere, Replicate, Ollama) out of the box and the ability to integrate custom APIs.

## Getting Started

You can get started by running `npx assistant-ui create` (new project) or `npx assistant-ui init` (existing project) in your terminal.
