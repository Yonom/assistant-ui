title: Message Branching
description: Switch between different conversation branches.
---

A new branch is created when:

- a user message is edited
- an assistant message is reloaded


Branches are automatically tracked by assistant-ui by observing changes to the `messages` array.

## Enabling branch support

You can show a branch picker by using `BranchPickerPrimitive`.

```tsx {1, 8, 15-30}
import { BranchPickerPrimitive } from "assistant-ui";


const Message = () => {
  return (
    <MessagePrimitive.Root>
      ...
      <BranchPicker /> {/* <-- show the branch picker */}
      ...
    </EditComposerPrimitive.Root>
  );
};


const BranchPicker = () => {
  return (
    <BranchPickerPrimitive.Root hideWhenSingleBranch>
      <BranchPickerPrimitive.Previous />
      <BranchPickerPrimitive.Number /> / <BranchPickerPrimitive.Count />
      <BranchPickerPrimitive.Next />
    </BranchPickerPrimitive.Root>
  );
};
```


## API

You can access the current branch state or navigate via the API as well.  
These APIs rely on the message state and may only be called inside a message component.

```tsx
// reading the current state
const { branchId, branchCount } = useBranchState(); // (TODO: coming soon)
const hasBranches = useMessageIf({ hasBranches: true });  // whether branchCount is >= 2


// navigation
const goToNextBranch = useGoToNextBranch(); // null if there is no next branch
const goToPreviousBranch = useGoToPreviousBranch(); // null if there is no previous branch
```
