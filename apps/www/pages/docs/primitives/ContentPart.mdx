## API Reference

### Provider

The context provider for the content part. This is usually handled by `<MessagePrimitive.Content />` so you do not need to use this component directly.

### InProgressIndicator

Only rendered when the content part is in progress. While a message is in progress, the very last content part is considered to be in progress. This component acts as a portal host for `<MessagePrimitive.InProgress />`.
