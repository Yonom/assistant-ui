## API Reference

### Provider

The context provider for the content part. This is usually handled by `<MessagePrimitive.Content />` so you do not need to use this component directly.

### LoadingIndicator

Only rendered when the content part is loading. While a Thread is running, the very last content part is considered to be loading. This component acts as a portal host for `<MessagePrimitive.Loading />`.
