### Composable Primitives

Inspired by [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives), composable primitives allow you to mix and match the subset of features that you need.

### Unstyled Components

assistant-ui does not ship with any styling or CSS code. Instead, you start with a starter template in your repository and adjust it as needed.

### Open and Extensible

You have access to the entire internal state of assistant-ui and can mix and match your own promitives with ours.

### Architecture

`assistant-ui` consists of two parts, **_Runtime_** and **_UI Components_**.

  className="mx-auto my-2 dark:hue-rotate-180 dark:invert"
/>

The Runtime and UI Components each require independent setup and both must be set up.
