Assistant UI is a React component library to build conversational user interfaces.

### Composable Primitives

Every app is unique and requires a different subset of features. Composable primitives allow you to mix and match the subset of features that you need.
This is a more robust approach compared to a one size fits all component with lots of props and has been inspired by cmdk, radix-ui and others.

### Unstyled Components

assistant-ui does not ship with any styling or CSS code. Instead, you copy paste a starter template (including styles) in your repository and adjust it as needed.

### Open and Extensible

You have access to the entire internal state of assistant-ui and can mix and match your own promitives with ours.
