### Composable Primitives

Inspired by [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives), composable primitives allow you to mix and match the subset of features that you need. 

### Unstyled Components

assistant-ui does not ship with any styling or CSS code. Instead, you start with a starter template in your repository and adjust it as needed.

### Open and Extensible

You have access to the entire internal state of assistant-ui and can mix and match your own promitives with ours.
