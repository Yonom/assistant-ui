If you are already using the Vercel AI SDK, assistant-ui can be used as a drop-in replacement for your existing UI. Simply follow the instructions for the API you are using (`useChat`, `useAssistant` or `ai/rsc`).

If you are not using the Vercel AI SDK, it is currently recommended to start with Vercel AI SDK UI `useChat`. Simply follow the [useChat](/docs/runtimes/vercel-ai-sdk/use-chat) guide.
