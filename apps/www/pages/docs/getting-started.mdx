## Start with a new project

<Steps>

### Create a new project

Create a new project with `assistant-ui` pre-configured:

```sh
npx assistant-ui@latest create my-app
cd my-app
```

### Add API key

Add a new `.env` file to your project with your OpenAI API key:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Start the app

```sh
npm run dev
```
</Steps>

## Install in an existing app


<Steps>

### Setup Runtime

You wrap your entire app in a `<AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>` component.

This component makes a `Runtime` available to the rest of your app.
The `Runtime` takes care of LLM communication, tools, streaming, state management, branching, persistence, authentication and more.

Refer to [Picking a Runtime](/docs/runtimes/pick-a-runtime) to pick the right runtime for your use case.

### Setup UI Components

The easiest way to get started is with `shadcn/ui` + `tailwind` components.

Currently, two modes are supported:

- [`<AssistantModal />`](/docs/ui/AssistantModal): a modal chat UI in the bottom right corner
- [`<AssistantSidebar />`](/docs/ui/AssistantSidebar): a sidebar chat UI
- [`<Thread />`](/docs/ui/Thread): the raw chat UI

</Steps>
