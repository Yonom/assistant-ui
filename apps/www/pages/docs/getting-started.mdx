## Architecture

`assistant-ui` consists of two parts, ***Runtime*** and ***UI Components***.

The Runtime and UI Components each require independent setup and both must be set up.

## Setup

The recommended way to get started is with the following stack:

- NextJS
- Vercel's `ai` package
- `tailwindcss` for styling
- `shadcn/ui` for UI components

### Step 1: Setup Runtime

You wrap your entire app in a `<AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>` component. 

This component makes a `Runtime` available to the rest of your app.
The `Runtime` takes care of LLM communication, tools, streaming, state management, branching, persistence, authentication and more.

Refer to [Picking a Runtime](/docs/runtimes/pick-a-runtime) to pick the right runtime for your use case.

### Step 2: Setup UI Components

The easiest way to get started is with `shadcn/ui` + `tailwind` components.

Currently, two modes are supported:

- [`<AssistantModal />`](/docs/ui/AssistantModal): a modal chat UI in the bottom right corner
- [`<AssistantSidebar />`](/docs/ui/AssistantSidebar): a sidebar chat UI
- [`<Thread />`](/docs/ui/Thread): the raw chat UI
