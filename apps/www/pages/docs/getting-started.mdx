The recommended way to get started is with the `@assistant-ui/shadcn` starter template. This template is built with `tailwind` and `shadcn-ui`. You can adjust these styles and adapt them to your application as needed.

First, set up `shadcn-ui` by following the installation guide: 

https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation

Then, add `@assistant-ui/shadcn` to your project:

```sh
npx @assistant-ui/shadcn add thread
```

This adds a `/components/ui/assistant-ui/thread.tsx` file to your project, which you can adjust as needed.

Use the `Thread` component in your application:

```tsx
import { VercelAIThreadProvider } from '@assistant-ui/react';
import { Thread } from '@/components/ui/assistant-ui/thread';
import { useChat } from 'ai'; 

function ChatBox() {
  const chat = useChat();
  return (
    <VercelAIThreadProvider chat={chat}>
      <Thread />
    </VercelAIThreadProvider>
  );
}
```

### Manual Installation

If your stack is not compatible with the `@assistant-ui/shadcn` starter template, you can install `@assistant-ui/react` manually. 
You can check out the source code of the starter template as a reference implementation.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @assistant-ui/react
```
