`assistant-ui` consists of two parts, `runtime` and `ui`.  
You need to setup the `runtime` before you can use any `ui` components.

The recommended way to get started is with the following stack:

- NextJS
- Vercel's `ai` package
- `tailwindcss` for styling
- `shadcn/ui` for UI components

## Step 1: Setup the Runtime

You wrap your entire app in a `<AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>` component. 

This component makes a `Runtime` available to the rest of your app.
The `Runtime` takes care of LLM communication, tools, streaming, state management, branching, persistence, authentication and more.

Refer to [Picking a Runtime](/docs/runtimes/pick-a-runtime) to pick the right runtime for your use case.

## Step 2: Use the UI Components

The easiest way to get started is with `shadcn/ui` + `tailwind` components.

Currently, two modes are supported:

- [`<AssistantModal />`](/docs/ui/assistant-modal): a modal chat UI in the bottom right corner
- [`<Thread />`](/docs/ui/thread): a chat UI with a sidebar
