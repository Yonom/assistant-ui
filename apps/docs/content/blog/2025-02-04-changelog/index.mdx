  This is the first edition of our changelog. We post these updates on a monthly
  basis. If you want more frequent updates about our new features, join our
  Discord where we have a `#changelog` channel that is updated on a daily basis.
</Callout>

## Summary

In January, we shipped 36 new versions of our package `@assistant-ui/react`. We also crossed 10k weekly downloads on npm for the first time. ðŸŽ‰

## shadcn/ui CLI support

You can now install all components using the shadcn CLI, e.g.

```sh
npx shadcn@latest add "https://r.assistant-ui.com/thread"
```

We began a migration towards distributing our components as unstyled primitives and using the shadcn CLI to drop styles in your project.

## Styled components moved to @assistant-ui/react-ui

All styled components (Thread, ThreadList, AssistantModal, makeMarkdownText, etc.) have been moved to a new package, `@assistant-ui/react-ui`.

To ease the migration, we added a migration codemod:

```sh
npx assistant-ui upgrade
```

This will update your codebase to use the new package. This new package remains supported, however, based on the learnings from existing users, we recommend all new projects to use our shadcn/ui CLI instead.

## Customizing the max-width of the Thread

You can now customize the max-width of the thread via `--aui-thread-max-width` CSS variable.

## Thread Management

One of our main focus areas in this month was on the new Thread Management API. The new ThreadList API is available under `runtime.threads`. It allows you to create, switch to, rename, archive, and delete threads.

We shipped a `<ThreadList />` component which gives the user the UI to manage their threads.

We also shipped a few hooks `useThreadListItem()`, `useThreadListItemRuntime()`, `useRemoteThreadListRuntime()` and `useCloudThreadListRuntime()`.

## Assistant Cloud

We rolled out the new Assistant Cloud service to early users. This is a managed service for persistence, chat history, and thread management.
Our runtimes are being upgraded to support Assistant Cloud natively by letting you pass a `cloud` object to the runtime hook.

Keep an eye out for the public announcement of Assistant Cloud in a few days.

## Improvements to our LangGraph Integration

- We now have full support for LangGraph's `interrupt()`/`Command` API. You can check out the new example repository [here](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui-langgraph-interrupt).
- We now also support starting LangGraph runs without a user message (based on button input or other events).
- Cancellation of runs is now supported via an `abortSignal` being passed to the LangGraph runtime adapter.

## Improvements to our AI SDK Integration

We now give you access to annotations and data packets in the assistant message:

```tsx
type AssistantMessage = {
  metadata: {
    unstable_annotations: [...],
    unstable_data: [...],
  }
}
```

## AI SDK recommended for new projects

For new projects, we recommend using the AI SDK integration. Previously, we recommended our custom SDK called `useEdgeRuntime`.  
With our improved AI SDK integration, we believe it is time to recommend AI SDK for new projects, giving you access to the AI SDK ecosystem.

The edge runtime remains maintained and supported for existing projects.
