After spending the last two years building Gen-AI prototypes and products, I realized that all software will soon have a natural language interface. OpenAI's ChatGPT sets the quality bar high and I wanted to have a similar UX in my own apps. No solution on the market came anywhere close, so I built assistant-ui.

assistant-ui is an open-source, embeddable, customizable AI chat component for React web apps. You can use it to build GPT wrappers, in-app copilots, or agentic systems. It supports rich content (markdown, code highlighting, charts, tables), generative UI, message editing, ..., across all the major model providers.

Earlier last month, I released the project to the world. The feedback from early adopters has been overwhelmingly positive:

<div className="not-prose mx-auto max-w-md">
  <TestimonialContainer testimonials={BLOG_TESTIMONIALS} />
</div>

It didn't take long for developers to start building with assistant-ui. Here are some of my favorite products from the community:

- [Helicone](https://helicone.ai/) - open-source LLM observability platform
- [screenpipe](https://screenpi.pe/) - AI to remember everything you see, say or hear
- [myresume.guru](http://myresume.guru) - AI resume optimizer to land your dream job
- [Entelligence](https://entelligence.ai/) - AI mentor for software engineers

With 250+ stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yonom/assistant-ui) and over 1k [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@assistant-ui/react) weekly downloads, we got a vibrant growing community of developers who care about the user experience.

I want to thank the following contributors who got the project to where it is today:

- [@m13v](https://github.com/m13v) for contributing two examples and several how-to videos
- [@okisdev](https://github.com/okisdev) for multiple bugfixes
- [@Rajaniraiyn](https://github.com/Rajaniraiyn) for improving streaming support for REST APIs
- [@ccbkai](https://github.com/ccbkai) for integrating Chrome's `window.ai` with assistant-ui
- [@stingfeng](https://github.com/stingfeng/dify-extensions) for building a [Dify](https://dify.ai) integration
- [@Ephibbs](https://github.com/Ephibbs/flowtoken) for building a Perplexity-style text streaming library ([Demo](https://assistant-ui-flowtoken-demo.vercel.app/))
- â€¦ and so many others

assistant-ui builds on top of [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) and other amazing open-source projects.

Over the coming month, I'll be rolling out multimodal support, so you can use your voice and upload images. There's so much more in the pipeline that I can't wait to unveil!

Today, several companies like [Helicone (YC W23)](https://x.com/justinstorre/status/1816849882612904156) are using assistant-ui to power a core part of their product. If your company wants to do the same, please [get in touch](https://cal.com/simon-farshid/assistant-ui).
