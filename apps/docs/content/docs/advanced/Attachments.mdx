Allow the user to attach files to their messages.

## Enabling attachments

In order to enable attachments, you need to pass a `AttachmentAdapter` to the `useEdgeRuntime` hook.

In this example, we use a `CompositeAttachmentAdapter` that allows the user to attach images and text.
The CompositeAttachmentAdapter allows you to combine multiple attachment adapters into one.

```tsx title="/app/MyRuntimeProvider.tsx"
import { useEdgeRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react";
import {
  CompositeAttachmentAdapter,
  SimpleImageAttachmentAdapter,
  SimpleTextAttachmentAdapter,
} from "@assistant-ui/react";

const runtime = useEdgeRuntime({
  api: "/api/chat",
  adapters: {
    attachments: new CompositeAttachmentAdapter([
      new SimpleImageAttachmentAdapter(),
      new SimpleTextAttachmentAdapter(),
    ]),
  },
});
```
