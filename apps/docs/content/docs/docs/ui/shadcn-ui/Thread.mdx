## Overview

The raw message list and message composer UI. Useful for full screen chat use cases.

## Getting Started

### Initialize `shadcn-ui`

```sh
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

### Add `thread`

```sh
npx assistant-ui@latest add thread
```

This adds a `/components/ui/assistant-ui/thread.tsx` file to your project, which you can adjust as needed.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  The `thread` template is minimal and does not include branching or editing support.

Alternatively, you can add `thread-full`, which includes branching and editing enabled by default.

```sh
npx assistant-ui@latest add thread-full
```

</Callout>

  </Step>
  <Step>

### Use in your application

import { Thread } from "@/components/ui/assistant-ui/thread";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="h-full">
      <Thread />
    </div>
  );
}
```
