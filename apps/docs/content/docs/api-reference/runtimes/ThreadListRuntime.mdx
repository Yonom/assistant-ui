### Access via `useAssistantRuntime`

You can access the thread list runtime via the assistant runtime:

```tsx
import { useAssistantRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react";

const threadListRuntime = useAssistantRuntime().threadList;
```

<ParametersTable {...ThreadListRuntime} />

### `useThreadList`

This hook provides access to the thread list state:

```tsx
import { useThreadList } from "@assistant-ui/react";

const threadList = useThreadList();
const threads = useThreadList((m) => m.threads);
```

<ParametersTable {...ThreadListState} />
