title: Walkthrough -Assistant Cloud with LangGraph Cloud
---

## Overview

With the help of assistant-cloud, you can add thread management and thread history capabilities to assistant-ui.  
This guide will walk you through the process of integrating assistant-cloud with LangGraph Cloud.

### Prerequisites

You need an assistant-cloud account to follow this guide.  
You can sign up for the waitlist here: https://accounts.assistant-ui.com/waitlist

### Setting up an assistant-cloud project

To get started, follow the steps below:

- Create a new project on the assistant-cloud dashboard.
- Navigate to the "Settings" tab and copy the Frontend API URL.
- Add this URL to your .env file

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL=https://<your-frontend-api-url>
```

### Setting up authorization

This guide will use Clerk for authorization. For other options, refer to the [authorization guide](/docs/cloud/authorization).

First, go to the Clerk dashboard and under "Configure" tab, "JWT Templates" section, create a new template. Choose a blank template and name it "assistant-ui".

As the "Claims" field, enter the following:

```json
{
  "aud": "assistant-ui"
}
```

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  <b>Note:</b> The aud claim ensures that the JWT is only valid for the
  assistant-ui API.
</Callout>

You can leave everything else as default. Take note of the "Issuer" and "JWKS Endpoint" fields.

Then, In the assistant-cloud dashboard, navigate to the "Auth Rules" tab and create a new rule. Choose "Clerk" and enter the Issuer and JWKS Endpoint from the previous step. As the "Audience" field, enter "assistant-ui".

### Connecting the runtime provider

Now that we have everything set up, let's write the code for the runtime provider.

The code below is a simple LangGraph runtime provider that uses the assistant-cloud API to create and manage threads.

```tsx twoslash {1-2,5-6,19,27,29-36,38-45}
// @errors: 2307

"use client";

import {
  AssistantCloud,
  AssistantRuntimeProvider,
  useCloudThreadListRuntime,
  useThreadListItemRuntime,
} from "@assistant-ui/react";
import { useLangGraphRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react-langgraph";
import { createThread, getThreadState, sendMessage } from "@/lib/chatApi";
import { LangChainMessage } from "@assistant-ui/react-langgraph";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { useMemo } from "react";

// ---cut---
const useMyLangGraphRuntime = () => {
  const threadListItemRuntime = useThreadListItemRuntime();
  const runtime = useLangGraphRuntime({
    stream: async function* (messages) {
      const { externalId } = await threadListItemRuntime.initialize();
      if (!externalId) throw new Error("Thread not found");

      return sendMessage({ threadId: externalId, messages });
    },
    onSwitchToThread: async (externalId) => {
      const state = await getThreadState(externalId);
      return {
        messages:
          (state.values as { messages?: LangChainMessage[] }).messages ?? [],
      };
    },
  });

  return runtime;
};

export function MyRuntimeProvider({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  const { getToken } = useAuth();

  const cloud = useMemo(
    () =>
      new AssistantCloud({
        baseUrl: process.env["NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL"]!,
        authToken: async () => getToken({ template: "assistant-ui" }),
      }),
    [getToken],
  );

  const runtime = useCloudThreadListRuntime({
    cloud,
    runtimeHook: useMyLangGraphRuntime,
    create: async () => {
      const { thread_id } = await createThread();
      return { externalId: thread_id };
    },
  });

  return (
    <AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>
      {children}
    </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
  );
}
```

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Observe that the `useMyLangGraphRuntime` hook is extracted into a separate
  function. This hook will be mounted multiple times, once per active thread.
</Callout>

### Displaying a ThreadList component

Now, you can add a ThreadList component to your application. This component will display a list of threads and allow users to switch between them.

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-[250px_1fr]">
  <ThreadList />
  <Thread />
</div>
```

Customization of this ThreadList component is possible, refer to the `Decomposition` guide [here](/docs/ui/styled/Decomposition#threadlist).
