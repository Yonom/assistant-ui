Assistant Cloud is a hosted service built for assistant-ui frontends.

## Features

### Thread management

Using our `<ThreadList />` component, show the users a list of conversations. Allow the users to seamlessly switch between conversations and even let long running tasks run in the background.

Assistant Cloud automatically persists a list of threads and corresponding metadata. It also automatically generates a title for conversations based on the initial messages.

Supported backends:

- AI SDK
- LangGraph
- Custom

### Chat history

For every conversation, Assistant Cloud can store the history of messages, allowing the user to resume the conversation at any point in time.
This supports human in the loop workflows, where the execution of an agent is interrupted until user feedback is collected.

Supported backends:

- AI SDK
- LangGraph
- Custom (currently only Local Runtime)

### Authorization

Assistant Cloud integrates with your auth provider (Clerk, Auth0, Supabase, Firebase, ...) to identify your users and authorize them to access just the conversations they are allowed to see.

Supported auth providers:

- Clerk
- Auth0
- Supabase
- Firebase
- Your own
