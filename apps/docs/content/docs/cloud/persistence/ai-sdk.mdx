---

## Overview

With the help of assistant-cloud, you can add thread management and thread history capabilities to assistant-ui.  
This guide will walk you through the process of integrating assistant-cloud with the AI SDK by Vercel.

### Prerequisites

You need an assistant-cloud account to follow this guide.  
You can sign up here: https://cloud.assistant-ui.com/

### Setting up an assistant-cloud project

To get started, follow the steps below:

- Create a new project on the assistant-cloud dashboard.
- Navigate to the "Settings" tab and copy the Frontend API URL.
- Add this URL to your .env file

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL=https://<your-frontend-api-url>
```

### Displaying a ThreadList component

Now, you can add a ThreadList component to your application. This component will display a list of threads and allow users to switch between them.

```sh
npx shadcn@latest add "https://r.assistant-ui.com/thread-list"
```

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-[250px_1fr]">
  <ThreadList />
  <Thread />
</div>
```
