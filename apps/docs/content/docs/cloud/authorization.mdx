title: User Authorization
---

The assistant-ui API can be directly accessed by your frontend. This elliminates the need for a backend server from your side, except for authorization of your users.

This document explains how you can setup your server to authorize users to access the assistant-ui API.

## Workspaces

Authorization is granted to a workspace. Depending on the structure of your app, you might want to use user_ids as the workspace_id, or you might want to use a more complex structure.
For example, if your app supports multiple "projects", you might want to use the project_id + user_id as the workspace id (thread history scoped to user+project pairs).

## Workspace Auth Tokens

assistant-ui issues workspace auth tokens. These tokens give access to the assistant-ui API for a specific workspace.
Tokens are short lived (5 minutes), so the client needs to periodically request a new token (handled by assistant-ui).

There are two supported approaches to obtain a workspace auth token:

- Direct integration with your auth provider
- From a backend server / serverless function

### Choosing the right approach

Direct integration with your auth provider:

- simpler to setup and maintain
- assigns a workspace_id to every user (by using the user_id as the workspace_id)
- requires a supported auth provider (Clerk, Auth0, Supabase, Firebase, Stytch, Kinde, ...)

Backend server:

- more complex to setup
- more flexible workspace structure (multi-user workspaces, workspaces per project, etc.)
- supports self hosted auth solutions, e.g. Auth.js
- requires a backend server / serverless function

You can always switch between the two approaches without any downtime or necessary database migrations.
Choose direct integration with your auth provider if you can. Otherwise, use a backend server.

### Auth Provider Integration

In the dashboard, go to the "Auth Integrations" tab and add a new integration.
Follow the steps to add your auth provider.

Then, pass in a function to `authToken` that returns an ID token from your auth provider.
The following is an example for Clerk:

```ts
import { AssistantCloud } from "@assistant-ui/cloud";

const assistantCloud = new AssistantCloud({
  authToken: () => clerkClient.sessions.getToken(auth(), "assistant-ui"),
});
```

### Backend Integration

In the dashboard, go to the "API Keys" tab and add a new API key.

Then, in a backend route, call `assistantCloud.auth.getToken({ workspaceId })`.

The following is an example to get auth tokens for Clerk based on the org_id and user_id:

```ts title="/app/api/assistant-ui-token/route.ts"
import { AssistantCloud } from "@assistant-ui/cloud";

const assistantCloud = new AssistantCloud({
  apiKey: <your api key>,
});

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
  const { org_id, user_id } = auth();

  if (!user_id) throw new Error("User not authenticated");

  const workspaceId = org_id ? `${org_id}:${user_id}` : user_id;
  const authToken = assistantCloud.auth.tokens.create({ workspaceId });

  return new Response(token);
};
```

```ts title="client.ts"
import { AssistantCloud } from "@assistant-ui/cloud";

const assistantCloud = new AssistantCloud({
  authToken: () =>
    fetch("/api/assistant-ui-token", { method: "POST" }).then((r) => r.json()),
});
```
