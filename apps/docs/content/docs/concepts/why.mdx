title: Why assistant-ui?
---

assistant-ui is a collection of powerful, modular primitives to build AI chat interfaces.

The modular approach means that you can incrementally adopt assistant-ui (e.g. use the backend connectors and bring your own components, or use the frontend compoents and bring your own backend).
You can also partially opt out of assistant-ui whenever you hit any limitation in the library.
