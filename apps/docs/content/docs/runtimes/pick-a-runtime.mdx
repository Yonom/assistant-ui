title: Picking a Runtime
---

assistant-ui offers a variety of runtimes for different use cases.

## New Chatbot

The following runtimes are recommended for new apps:

- [Edge](/docs/runtimes/edge)
- [LangGraph Cloud](/docs/runtimes/langgraph)
- [Trieve](/docs/runtimes/trieve)

### Edge Runtime

The Edge Runtime is assistant-ui's native runtime.

### LangGraph Cloud

The LangGraph Cloud runtime lets you build stateful agents with LangGraph.

### Trieve

Build chatbots that can interact with your content with Trieve.ai, one of the most powerful RAG APIs.

### Vercel AI SDK

If you are already using the Vercel AI SDK, there are four ways to integrate:

- [Edge Runtime with Data Stream Protocol](/docs/runtimes/edge)
- [useChat Runtime]
- [useAssistant Runtime]
- [RSC Runtime]

## Already using one of our supported backends

We have native integrations for the following backends:

- [LangGraph](/docs/runtimes/langgraph)
- [Trieve](/docs/runtimes/trieve)
- [Vercel AI SDK](/docs/runtimes/vercel-ai-sdk)

## Already using a custom backend

For custom backends, we have two entrypoints for integration:

- [Custom REST API](/docs/runtimes/custom-rest)
- [External Store](/docs/runtimes/external-store)
