assistant-ui offers a variety of runtimes for different use cases.

## New Chatbot

The following runtimes are recommended for new apps:

- [AI SDK](/docs/runtimes/ai-sdk/use-chat)
- [LangGraph Cloud](/docs/runtimes/langgraph)

### Vercel AI SDK

AI SDK by Vercel lets you build conversational AI agents.

### LangGraph Cloud

The LangGraph Cloud runtime lets you build stateful agents with LangGraph.

## Already using a custom backend

For custom backends, we have two entrypoints for integration:

- [External Store](/docs/runtimes/external-store)
- [Custom REST API](/docs/runtimes/custom-rest)
