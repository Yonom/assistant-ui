## Assistant Message Status / Content Part Status

The previous `AssistantMessage.status` field has been reworked:

- `in_progress` is now `{ type: "running" }`
- `error` is now `{ type: "incomplete", reason: "error", error: unknown }`

The previous value `done` now maps to one of the following values:

- `{ type: "requires-action", reason: "tool-calls" }`
- `{ type: "complete", reason: "stop" | "unknown" }`
- `{ type: "incomplete", reason: "cancelled" | "tool-calls" | "length" | "content-filter" | "other" }`

The same applies to `ContentPart` status fields.
